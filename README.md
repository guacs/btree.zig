# btree.zig

This is an implementation of a BTree. The implementation is based heavily on [this post](https://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/rust-btree-case/) that
explains the implementation of the `BTreeMap` in the Rust standard library. And by "heavily" I mean it's an almost exact port of the Rust implementation.

NOTE: The current implementation of `BTreeMap` in the Rust standard library seems to be quite different to the version explained in the blog post.

If you have any issues/feedback or potential improvements, please create an issue or raise a PR. I would greatly appreciate it!
